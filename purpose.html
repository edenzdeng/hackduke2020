        Nearly 100,000 small businesses that temporarily shut down due to the pandemic have closed permanently. Local mom and pop shops are suffering more than ever, struggling to pay bills, constantly adapting to new government regulations, and competing with larger chains -- on top of dealing with the emotional, physical, and mental toll of the pandemic.

    QUOTES:
    “Choosing to support an independent business is an act of respect; it’s acknowledging the tremendous risk and challenges inherent to starting your own thing.” - Matt Kliegman (co-founder - The Smile, The Smile To Go, Black Seed Bagels)
    
    “These are establishments that are often the character of a neighborhood, a community. The relationships created between customers and those that work in independent business frequently go beyond just purchases — it becomes familial.” - Rembert Browne (culture critic at large - New York Magazine).
    
    “Most independent businesses are run by people - not by boards, not by stockholders, not by algorithms. And so you get a different kind of care and quality in their product because their work is a reflection of themselves. Instead of focusing on the next market they’re expanding into or the next round of funding they’re raising, they’re focusing on the details and being the best they can be.” - Erica Cerulo and Claire Mazur (co-founders - Of a Kind)."
