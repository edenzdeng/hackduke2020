Describe the problem your solution addresses? (150 word limit)

The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted so many different aspects of life and all major industries, but one of the most negatively impacted sectors is the restaurant and food service industry. It is the smaller food businesses and independent restaurants that continue to face the brunt of the economic crisis. Larger chain restaurants are simply more equipped to handle the coronavirus shutdowns as smaller businesses scramble for financial support from the government and customers. Spreading your dollar to these small businesses, rather than big chains, is crucial to keeping the restaurants open so the owners and their employers can continue to make ends meet despite the incredible financial stress created by COVID-19 restrictions. SmartBizEats aims to address the issue of smaller businesses suffering financially by offering a search query that filters out independent restaurants based on your location. 

Through the use of our site's search bar, users help restaurants in their localities by directly ordering food from the small food businesses and restaurants nearby. While satisfying their appetite by buying from the restaurants featured on our site, users in turn help their local restaurants and small food businesses stay running. As more and more smaller restaurants are forced to close due to COVID-19 restrictions taking a toll on owners economically, it is local communities that have the power to help their neighbors stay afloat. By putting money in the hands of smaller food businesses and their owners and limiting purchases from chain-restaurants, SmartBizEats' users help support a sector of the small business community that is hurting financially especially now.
